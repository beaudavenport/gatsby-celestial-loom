**TAPESTRIES OF TIME**

**Outer Planets Through the Rest of 2023**    

An Astrological Online Playshop

Saturday, June 10, 2023 – ZOOM Meeting 4:30 PM – 6:00 PM CDT

_**“Every inquiring human, by rights, should know something about the planets.”**_                                                    

The outer planets are strands of powerful energy of different colors and flavors which become woven together over time. Join us to review the next six months of 2023 and learn how to connect cosmic time and space into your personal chart and utilize the great planetary gifts opening new awareness and understanding currently for each of us.

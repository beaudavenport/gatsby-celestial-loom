**Manwe, Sedna, and Haumea** are Ice Dwarf planets beyond Pluto (who is also an Ice Dwarf).  These outer planets stay in one sign for a very long time and all three of them are now shifting to new signs at the same time.  They also are in a very profound sacred geometry pattern in the sky - "Finger of God."  This is a major cosmic energy and message that will unfold in 2023 and over the next few years.  Join us to see how this works in your chart and learn how to tap in to a universal, evolutionary astrology that is giving us a peek at the view from the Top of the Mountain!

Playshop is **FREE OF CHARGE**.

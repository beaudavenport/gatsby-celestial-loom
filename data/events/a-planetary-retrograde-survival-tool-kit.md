**A Planetary RETROGRADE Survival Tool Kit**

**(To Help Us Get Through the Summer, 2020)**

An Online (ZOOM) Astrological Playshop

**Sunday, May 31, 2020    5-6:30 PM CDT**

_“Our inner environment is what God watches.”_  Sraddha Mata, SRF

When planets are Retrograde, it’s the perfect time to revisit and restructure thought and belief patterns that no longer serve you.  Ask yourself: “How would I like to rewrite my story?”  We can’t deal with retrograde without understanding surrender. It requires the force of the will to unleash attachment. 

**_“You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you just might find, you get what you need.”_** Mick Jagger

The Spring, Summer of 2020 carries 8 planets, 2 asteroid goddesses, and shaman Chiron all turning Retrograde.  Join us to discover some practical actions to take during this challenging time.  We’ll also explore our personal birth chart planetary retrograde energies.

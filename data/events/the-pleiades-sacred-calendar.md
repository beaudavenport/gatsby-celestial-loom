_“Love knows not distance; It hath no continent; Its eyes are for the stars.”_  

\-Lucinda Riley                                                                                                                           

Join us for a cosmic navigational journey to Venus, Star Group Pleiades – Seven Weeping Sisters, the mythology of ancient day-keeping cultures and the astrology of the 20 day-signs/13 numbers sacred calendar tied to the Mayan Culture.

This 3-week mini-class will introduce us to a new astrological perspective, and set us on a pathway to utilize our personal, daily sacred energy source, keep our own days, and vision the future.  We will start our year with a new sense of time, enriched understanding, and expanding hope.

**Visioning our Future – The Pleiades Sacred Calendar** will unfold in 3 weekly lessons.   

3-Hour Classes (3 weekly meetings) $100.00

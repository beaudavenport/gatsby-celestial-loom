**CLIMATE CRISIS, An Astrological Perspective**

**An AASTL Astrological Online Playshop – Nikki Davenport, Speaker**

**Sunday, July 23, 2023 – ZOOM Meeting 2:00 – 4:00 PM CDT**

“The “how” of astrometeorology – planets do not cause the weather; they reflect weather conditions.”

A predictive astrological look at climate and large-scale weather with a view of past events and how to chart future possible weather events.  We will look at planets and their aspects, solar ingresses and lunar phases, latitude and longitude, and other astrological factors.  A beginner’s guide to Astrometeorology.

This meeting is the monthly meeting for the Astrological Association of St. Louis (AASTL).  If you are not a member feel free to come as a guest. Contact Nikki, nikiastro@att.net or www.celestialloomastrology.com for PRE-REGISTRATION.  The LINK to the ZOOM meeting will be sent to your email a day prior to the 2-hour online meeting – free of charge.

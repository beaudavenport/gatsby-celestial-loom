**An Astrological Online Playshop** 

**Wednesday, April 22, 2020   6:00 – 7:00 PM**

**Link for location is Kirkwood Park - We are NOT meeting there but my program demands a location link.  The location is: Your Home and My ZOOM page!!!**

_“The beam of light the moon sends down has a magic touch.  She softly kisses my bare skin.  We are sisters.”_

Join us on ZOOM for a Goddess Taurus Moon (3 Taurus) celebration at our sacred MOON CIRCLE.  We will explore the healing lunar unfolding in April/May, learn about the “Lights Mandala,” and apply our personal chart Lunar Planner to our monthly timing.  The Taurus New Moon is all about Earth, healing, love, art and what we value.  

Come into the circle to tune into your personal artistic muse, explore Venus as she moves into Retrograde, and we will share some astrological skills coping tools for our current world reality.

One-Hour Playshop: Free as I’m still practicing my ZOOM skills and so much want to share the upcoming month cosmic energies with all of you!

Contact Nikki: nikiastro@att.net for PRE-REGISTRATION and include your birth info: birth date, birth time, birth location for your free astrological birth chart and monthly Lunar Planner which will be sent to you through your email.  After you are registered, I will send you, via email, the ZOOM link and password prior to the playshop.

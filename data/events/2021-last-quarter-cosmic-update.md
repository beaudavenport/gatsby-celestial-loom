**2021 Last Quarter Cosmic Update**

**ONLINE Astrological Playshop**

 **Saturday, October 9, 2021   4-5:30 PM CDT**

Join us on ZOOM for an online look at the rest of YEAR 2021. To help us on our journey through the next few months, **Nikki Davenport** will share an astrological update on the cosmic movements over the **Last Quarter 2021** – September 22 through December 22.

We will explore:

•	Check-In Points tied to Last Quarter Moon Phases and the last two Eclipses in 2021

•	One more Moon Wobble period that comes up before the end of the year

•	The third and final SATURN-URANUS square

•	A mundane look at Fall Equinox Ingress Chart, Winter Solstice Ingress Chart and their messages for us

•	Powerful planet shifts as they move on their Last Quarter Retrograde-Direct trek 

•	Sedna and her Last Quarter connections to the planets

It is up to us to outwit the stars, pull together, help each other, and share our creative ideas to get through the rest of the year!

**Playshop is free of charge.** 

**Contact Nikki: nikiastro@att.net or sign in on website event page to pre-register and share your email. ZOOM link will be sent one day prior to playshop.**

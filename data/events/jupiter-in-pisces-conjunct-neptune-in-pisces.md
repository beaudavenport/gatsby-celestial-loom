**The conjunction of Jupiter in Pisces with Neptune in Pisces** happening on **April 12, 2022** is the most important aspect this year!  It brings a powerful Jupiter-Neptune Synodic Cycle and also brings an exotic "hard to understand" cosmic gift.  

"**_I saw grief drinking a cup of sorrow and called out, ‘It tastes sweet, does it not?’ You’ve caught me,’ grief answered,’ and you’ve ruined my enterprise.  How can I sell sorrow, when you know it’s a blessing?”_**                                                                                                                  -Rumi

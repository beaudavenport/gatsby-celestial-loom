An Astrological Playshop 

Thursday, July 25, 2019   7:00 – 9:00 PM

DeMun Healing, 734 De Mun Ave., Clayton, MO 63105

_“The beam of light the moon sends down has a magic touch.  She softly kisses my bare skin.  We are sisters.”_

Join us for a Goddess Leo Moon (8 Leo) celebration at our sacred MOON CIRCLE.  We will explore the making “connections” lunar unfolding in August, learn about the “Lights Mandala,” and apply our personal chart Lunar Planner to our monthly timing.  The Leo New Moon is bursting with creativity and endless love from the heart. Leo links to the “Magician” in the Tarot and we’ll look at tools and skills to magically manifest great things.  

Relationships take center stage in August with the Moon conjunct Venus.  Come learn how to celebrate your best friends and lovers as part of our Leo New Moon learning!

2-Hour Playshop: $25.00

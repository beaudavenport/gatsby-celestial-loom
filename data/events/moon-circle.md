**An Astrological Playshop** 

**Thursday, August 29, 2019   7:00 – 9:00 PM**

**DeMun Healing, 734 De Mun Ave., Clayton, MO 63105**

_“The beam of light the moon sends down has a magic touch.  She softly kisses my bare skin.  We are sisters.”_

Join us for a Goddess VIRGO Moon (6 Virgo) celebration at our sacred MOON CIRCLE.  We will explore the making “connections” lunar unfolding in September, learn about the “Lights Mandala,” and apply our personal chart Lunar Planner to our monthly timing.   At Virgo New Moon Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and asteroid Juno line up in Virgo.  Virgo is called the “Womb of Time” and we’ll explore the power within us to perfect our healing work and serve each other with compassion. 

How are we healed and how are we assisting the healing of others? Together we will explore our personal precision and clarity through our words, through our magic hands, and through our hearts!

2-Hour Playshop: $25.00

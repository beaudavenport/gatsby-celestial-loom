**An Astrological Online Playshop**

**Saturday, November 5, 2022 – ZOOM Meeting 4-5 PM CDT**

Mars represents decisive action, our will-power, Kundalini forces in our Spinal Highway (Chakras).  He moves into inquisitive Gemini opening the door to a desire energy to share, learn, and verbally spar. Curiosity is at an all-time high, communication is at a fast pace and has powerful effectiveness.  Mis-information can unspool at a terrific speed!

_“Mars retrograde makes Mercury retrograde look like a baby!”_

Wherever Mars goes, he brings activity, vitality.  With Mars in Gemini, it is a time to dip ourselves into new waters and experience things we do not normally gravitate towards.  Our curiosity is at a high peak. Join us to learn how to keep a watch on MARS and its influence on our charts!

**This Playshop is FREE of CHARGE.** 

Contact Nikki, nikiastro@att.net for PRE-REGISTRATION. Let me know in my email by Friday, or sign up on my website. 

You will receive the LINK in your email on Saturday morning to ZOOM meeting at 4 PM CDT.

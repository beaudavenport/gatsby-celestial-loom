**An Online Astrological Playshop**

**Wednesday, May 13, 2020  Online through Zoom 4-5 PM CDT**

  **_“…When his love he doth espy, Let her shine as gloriously As Venus of the sky.”_**                                                Shakespeare:  A Midsummer Night’s Dream 

Venus, after the Moon, is our closest Celestial Goddess.  She is tied to our self-esteem, our value system, and how we love each other.  Her orbit moves through the solar system expressing the Venus-Earth relationship as the “Golden Ratio.” Her closeness to Earth when retrograde opens the doorway for us to examine our core values and what/who we hold most dear.  

Venus brings harmonic proportion into our charts and our lives.  

Agenda

•	Gemini Venus Synodic Cycle, June 2020/2021

•	Venus Retrograde 2020

•	Personal Venus STAR Point

•	A Venus/Moon Chakra Journey



When you go through the pay-pal/credit card process - you will be asked to put your birth info down.  This is your pre-registration.  After I receive your info I will send you your free Venus Star Chart and one day before the playshop I will send the ZOOM link and password, via your email.

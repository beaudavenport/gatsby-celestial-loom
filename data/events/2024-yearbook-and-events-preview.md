**Online Astrological Playshop ZOOM**

**Saturday,  February 17, 2024   2:00 PM - 4:00 PM CST** 

Join us on ZOOM to step into a magic door of new discovery learning about shaman Chiron and his fellow Centaurs and how they can enhance deep new understandings in your natal chart.   

Centaurs are trans-Saturnian objects that have only been discovered in the last quarter-century and are one of the newest additions to modern astrology. They are cosmic travelers as they move between Saturn and the three universal planets: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.  They are the Emissaries between our individual earth experiences and our greater spiritual searching.  The Centaurs symbolize that which is ‘hidden’ by the virtue of it being so obvious we do not even see it.  Join us to explore new mysteries within your being!

2-Hour Playshop - $25.00 (Payment at website: celestialloomastrology.com) 

Pre-registration with birth information for your Centaur Chart Packet (your name, birth DATE, birth TIME, and birth PLACE) should be emailed to Nikki at nikiastro@att.net.

**Mars Retrograde TRIPTIK - 2020 (ONLINE ZOOM FREE EVENT)**

I will be sharing my Mars Retrograde TRIPTIK - 2020 through a short ZOOM session on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 from 4:00 to 5:00 PM CDT.

**Mars turned Retrograde on September 9 and will direct on November 13.**  Our meeting will include a discussion about the Mars aspects and aspect meanings through the end of the year.  Also included a powerpoint with all the aspects and their meanings listed in TripTik format sent to your email after our discussion.

This is a tool I create and use for important retrograde cycles. **We are in a time of great stress and great opportunity as Mars is in his own sign of Aries, is closer to the Earth than his average distance (he penetrates the Sun-Earth enclave-the astronomical unit), and is making powerful connections with the Capricorn Stellium that defines our year.**

Sign up by sending me a note by Tuesday, September 22, at:  nikiastro@att.net with your name and your email. I will send the ZOOM link to your email the day prior to the meeting. 

Looking forward to sharing with you,

Nikki Davenport

**An Octave Journey of Soul to Spirit**

**Moon** is the personal connection to our Soul and our spiritual life.  **Ceres** is our Earth Mother connection to our place on planet Earth and our spiritual service.  **Sedna** is our universal connection to our role in the great whole of Spirit.  Join us as we take a look at our charts through a harmonic Octave Journey!

An Astrological Playshop

Thursday, December 19, 2019 6-9- PM

DeMun Healing, 734 De Mun Ave., Clayton MO 63105

_"The beam of light the moon sends down has a magic touch.  She softly kisses my bare skin.  We are sisters."_

Join us for a **Goddess Capricorn Moon (4 Capricorn)** celebration at our sacred MOON CIRCLE.  We will explore the making "connections" lunar unfolding in January, learn about the "Lights Mandala," and apply our personal chart Lunar Planner to our monthly timing.

The Capricorn Moon on December 25 is also an **Annular Solar Eclipse** ushering in major transformation as we open the door to the NEW YEAR.  January's lunar month connects with a powerful eclipse season that started on November 26 New Moon in Sagittarius and takes us on a Capricorn unfolding journey of great change through the month of January, 2020 and the seeding of a new world.

Join us to learn details for your personal chart that unfold during the magical Eclipse Season and New Year!

Contact Nikki at nikiastro@att.net for PRE-REGISTRATION and include your birth info: birth date, birth time, birth location, for your free astrological birth chart and monthly Lunar Planner.

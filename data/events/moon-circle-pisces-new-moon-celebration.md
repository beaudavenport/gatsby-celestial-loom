_“The beam of light the moon sends down has a magic touch.  She softly kisses my bare skin.  We are sisters.”_

Join us for a Goddess Pisces Moon (4 Pisces) celebration at our sacred MOON CIRCLE.  We will explore the making “connections” lunar unfolding in March, learn about the “Lights Mandala,” and apply our personal chart Lunar Planner to our monthly timing.  The Pisces New Moon brings flowing creativity, psychic healing, and a sharing of our Divine Essence.  Pisces takes us on an inner journey through reflection and illumination. Get ready to slip into your merciful and compassionate side.

Pisces is the dreamer and the “spiritual companion.” Our March lunar month brings new opening doors linked to our intuition. Pisces rules dreams, visions, art, music, and magical mysteries.  The Sabian Symbol for this New Moon is: “A church bazaar.”  Join us to learn where all the magic unfolds in your personal chart for the month of March!

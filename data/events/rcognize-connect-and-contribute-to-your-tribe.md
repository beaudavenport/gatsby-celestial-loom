**Saturday, October 19, 2019   1-4 PM**

**DeMun Healing, 734 De Mun Ave., Clayton, MO 63105**

How do we find our TRIBE, connect to our soul service, and utilize our dynamic will to help each other?  We will view, through our natal charts, who we are as individuals, and what we bring to humanity.

We will explore our “group discovery” through:

•	The Astrological Blueprint and our Resonating Archetypes

•	Our Past and Future Moon Gifts we bring to our TRIBE

•	Our Lunar Nodal Group Soul Patterns and Soul Potentials

•	Powerful Pluto Generational Dimensions

•	Pleiades Star Cluster Messages

•	Application of our “Whole Being – Here and Now” to our Group Circle

**3-Hour Playshop: $35.00** 

Contact Nikki:  nikiastro@att.net for PRE-REGISTRATION and include your birth info: birth date, birth time, birth location, for your free astrological birth chart and “Tribal Kit.”

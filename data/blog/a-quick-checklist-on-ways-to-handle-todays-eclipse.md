A Quick Checklist on Ways to Handle Today's Eclipse

* This is the first of three eclipses in the upcoming cycle.  June 5 Lunar Eclipse: 15 Sagittarius-15 Gemini, June 21 Solar Eclipse: 0 Cancer, July 4 Lunar Eclipse: 13 Capricorn-13 Cancer
* Today at 2:13 PM CDT - We are Threshold Walkers, Navigators, Travelers in a strange new world.
* A turning path for the collective and us personally - watch your step on the turns!
* We will pick up a lot of information over the next month.
* Energy is big and chaotic - go with the flow - _"Let Go and Let God."_
* What is the truth of my inner being and my outer life?
* A great challenge greets us.  Sun and Moon are square Mars and Neptune in Pisces.  Some things in our thoughts environment feel unbearable and confusion reigns - we are overwhelmed with "input."
* Collective grief and pain surrounds - we need to listen up and stay quiet so we can hear each other.
* Lunar Eclipse Earth shadows the Moon - time for our own personal "Shadow Work."
* Eclipse aligns with the "Great Attractor, a cosmic tractor beam pouring new insights and messaging - emotions are stirred.
* Difficulties and clear reason work together.
* Speak TRUTH!
* Time to get together with our Cancer tribe.
* We are guided by keen insight.
* We are heartbroken -we dig deep for our courageous inner voice.
* Let the ancestors give us a broader perspective.
* Eclipses bring growth, break through scars and pain, and explore knowledge, faith, mind, and heart.
* We are lost in manipulation, untruths, and foggy views - delusion.
* We are being awakened beyond the outworn conventions.  We are building a new world.
* What is real?
* What am I letting go?  What am I finishing?  What has come full circle in my life?
* We have reached a tipping point!

Love, Nikki

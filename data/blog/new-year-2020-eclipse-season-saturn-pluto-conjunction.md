Welcome to 2020!

_**“Nothing exists nor happens in the visible sky that is not sensed in some hidden moment by the faculties of Earth and Nature.”**_            Johannes Kepler   

We are entering a new year, a new decade, and a new transforming world!  The sky is ablaze with change and our Earth is aligned with new beginnings.  We start the year in a massive line-up of **Capricorn** planets.  Capricorn symbolizes the principle of cosmic order.  It is the archetype of the manifested spiritual force. 

The planets – Mercury, Jupiter, Moon’s South Node, Ceres, Saturn, Pluto – all in Capricorn at ECLIPSE  (Lunar Eclipse on January 10, 2020 @ 20 Cancer, 20 Capricorn) bring the needs of the moment and carry within themselves both the fulfillment of our needs, and the essential spiritual meaning made specifically for us! 

**Jupiter** is the benefactor who affirms for us _“I create a positive future in this moment.”_

**Ceres** is our Earth Mother and affirms _“I come to my inner child and we make our way in the world through love.”_

**Saturn** is our Spiritual Master and Spiritual Friend affirming _“I am secure in my divinity.”_

**Pluto** Is the Subterranean Destroyer and affirms _“I am a power for positive change.”_ 

We also ride into the new year during the **Mayan Shadow Days**: A 20-day collective shadow period which begins on “Being” day and ends on “Enlightening” day in the Pleiadian-Earth Calendar. The Shadow Days start on December 26, 2019 and go through January 14, 2020. This is a particularly potent time for awakening humans in the evolutionary process.  We will be illumined by the truth.  We can respond by changing our perspectives and opening our hearts!

A quick view of “Eclipse Season” in the first two weeks of January, 2020 awakening powerful planetary energy dates:

1-7-20: **Mercury conjunct Jupiter** (7 Capricorn)– we are illumined.

1-10-20: **Mercury conjunct Sun** (19 Capricorn) - we are enlightened with new understanding.

1-10-20: **Sun opposes Moon at LUNAR ECLIPSE**  (20 Capricorn/20 Cancer) - everything is changing.

1-11-20: **Mercury conjunct Ceres** (22 Capricorn) – we find unconditional love surrounding us.

1-12-20: **SATURN conjunct PLUTO** (22 Capricorn) – we walk through a new gateway.

1-13-20: **Saturn conjunct Ceres** (22 Capricorn) – we learn how to help each other be safe.

On September 10, 2021, Sweet Ganesha has his Ganesha Chiturthi - Birthday Celebration!

_**Ganesh gives us a rainbow for every storm, a smile for every tear, a promise for every care, and an answer to every prayer.”**_ 

GANESH IS THE Remover of Obstacles, the Lord of Astrology, the Protector of Children, and the God of Laughter.

Ganesh is the patron deity of astrologers in India.  Jyotishis (Vedic astrologers-practitioners of the “Science of Light”) turn to Lord Ganesh for guidance and inspiration when working on their science and doing charts for others.  Lord Ganesh takes the form of a human with an elephant head.  Elephants in India are prized for their high intelligence, extraordinary strength and unswerving devotion.

Lord Ganesh is depicted as a lover of sweets and is always eating candy.  His vehicle is a small mouse, who is always picking up and nibbling the little pieces of sweets and candy Lord Ganesh drops.  The mouse symbolizes the mind, always nibbling at the crumbs that fall from the wonders of God.

 I would like to introduce you to Lord Ganesh:

* Remover of Obstacles
* God of Happiness
* Patron of the Arts
* God of Children
* First Among the Celestials
* Master of the Word
* Patron of people who need to keep a lot of facts straight in their minds

Ganesh is associated with good living, success, peace, and happiness.  He represents the benefic planet JUPITER.  Some of his other symbols are:

* Lotus – the mind with the power of the lotus flower to open to God
* Conch Shell – the sound of the elephant’s call to prayer
* Chakra Discus – symbol of the Sun/mind and Moon/emotions
* Flower Arrow – Ganesh shoots flower-covered arrows from His sugar cane bow to guide his devotees
* Wish-fulfilling Tree – Ganesh holds a sprig of the tree to tell us our wishes will be gratified
* Third-Eye – he gives us spiritual sight
* Big-Belly – has the universe in his belly
* Crescent Moon – symbol of time passing, auspicious moments, and power of the mind
* Trees – Ganesh is the giver of gifts from healing trees – the professor of Ayurveda

AUM – THE COSMIC SOUND

Loving Ganesh is Aum,

He is the A, the base sound of the universe, 

He is the U, the sound of the galaxies,

He is the M, the sound of the planets and the littlest stars.

Love, Nikki

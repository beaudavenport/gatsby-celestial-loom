I'm on my way to NORWAC - an astrological convention in Seattle, WA.  It has been almost 20 years since I was at a big conference and I am bursting with delight.  The action begins on Friday, May 24 at 1:00 PM and the event chart explodes with "threshold walking!"  We are newly into Gemini opening new doors, learning new things, and ready for new experiences.  Mercury, also in Gemini, is running in front of the Sun in his own sign,  so we'll experience the Trickster in all his might over the next few weeks.  The convention Moon will be in Aquarius, taking all of our communication, learning, teaching, sharing, and experiencing the _**Cosmos**_ to a higher realm of understanding.

Join me!  I'll be sharing new learning each day and we can have some fun with the planets and the stars together!  Talk to you tomorrow!!  

Love, Nikki

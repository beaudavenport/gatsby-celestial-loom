_"The power of the world always works in circles, and everything tries to be round. The sky is round, and I have heard that the earth is like a ball, and so are the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls; birds make their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours. The sun and moon, both round, come forth and go down again in a circle.  Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. The life of a person is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves."_  Lakota Chief Black Elk

Eclipses have appeared in mythology in all different cultures, usually causing fear.  The word eclipse is a Greek word meaning “abandonment.”  An eclipse was seen as the Sun “abandoning” the earth.  An eclipse symbol is the dragon who eats the Sun.  The Incas tried to intimidate the creatures who were eating the Sun.  The ancient Chinese made lots of noise to scare the dragon.  The people of India got into water to help the Sun fight off the dragon.

**Solar Eclipse** at the New Moon is “external” and often unexpected – events that happen out in the world.

**Lunar Eclipse** at the Full Moon is “internal” and emotional – events brought about by feelings and thoughts.

Eclipse at North Node:  Beginning of major life issues, identity, ego, personal freedom, “me” principle, beginning something new.  At the North Node we are walking towards our destiny.  The eclipse can light the way and/or block the path.

Eclipse at South Node:  Issues with relationships, importance tied to new things we do with “others,” a new perspective based on interaction, “we” principle, more social coming out and public exposure.  At the South Node we are bringing to our path skills, abilities, talents, experiences that the eclipse can light up and/or block out.

**Eclipse Pointers:**

* Eclipses can “shake up our thinking” and bring a feeling of fated events.  They can bring a change in direction.  We can feel disoriented or “out of sorts” during eclipse times.
* Eclipses can shine a light of truth in our lives and at the same time create mystery and hidden secrets.
* We will feel more emotional than usual.
* We are more enlightened than usual.
* When we take action at an eclipse, the end result is usually not exactly what we expect.

There is a special galactic point in our Milky Way galaxy known as the “Great Attractor.” The enormous gravity of the Great Attractor is a bender of light.  Ceres, now a dwarf planet, stationed and turned retrograde on April 9, 2019 at the Great Attractor degree 14 Sagittarius.  On July 17, 2019 she turned direct at 0 Sagittarius and moving forward, she will again reengage with the Great Attractor at 14 Sagittarius on October 3, 2019.  As Ceres has moved through her retrograde cycle, she has been between the degrees of 0 Sagittarius and 14 Sagittarius throughout most of the year 2019, teaching us lessons about opening a new door to the entire galaxy, tuning in to the immense light and visionary understanding the Great Attractor expresses, and bringing enlightenment. We hold the key to the mystery of the universe and the potency of our souls.  This is because Ceres is all about love.

She is known as the dwarf planet Ceres, was discovered in 1801, has an orbital period of 4.6 years (1,682 days), and she represents the Great Mother – unconditional love.  Most astrologers know of her in her role as one of the four largest asteroids we utilize in our charts, Ceres, Juno, Pallas Athene, and Vesta.  She was reclassified as a dwarf planet as she is the largest planet in the asteroid belt and was renamed as an unambiguous minor planet inside Neptune’s orbit.  She is the thirty-third largest known body in the solar system.  

Ceres carries the energies of Earth Mother and helps us to return to alignment with our natural world.  She is the Earth Healer always concerned for the well being of the Earth and its occupants.  She carries our ancestry, the intuitive knowledge of natural laws, that which we need to feel nurtured in this life, and how we nurture those around us.  She brings awareness of the depth of love that sits within all of us, as well as grief, loss, separation, extended mourning, parent-child relationships, and “maiden, mother, crone.”  She rules famine and the ecology of food, the agricultural cycle, how we are fed, and climate change.  Ceres is the archetype tied to family, emotional connections, our young human self being cared for, the models of love and care we take into our lives, and how we show our love to each other.  

Our entire galaxy is moving toward the Great Attractor and it is in Sagittarius. In our personal sojourn on Earth we have Ceres-Earth Mother in Sagittarius for most of this year touching off the Great Attractor at 14 Sagittarius.  Locate the 0-14 Sagittarius degrees in your chart and turn to Mother to find the environment where you are opening to the deepest love, nurturing, helping, growing, and service full sharing. Streams of cosmic light download through our Earth Mother into our hearts.

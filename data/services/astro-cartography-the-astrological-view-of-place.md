Astro\*Cartography is how the placements of the planets affects the energies we feel in certain places we live or visit, depending on when and where we were born.  Astro\*Cartography can explain the reason behind your cravings and desires to visit a certain place and can also indicate your connections to those places even if you are not physically in that specific location.
